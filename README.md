# BezierCurve
Project will represent a Bezier Curve

Previous requirements:
- PyQt

Program draws Bezier Curve with points selected from user by mouse. First user must choose a polynomial of the curve. Amount of points is 
polynomial + 1. I used de Casteljau algoritm for drawing curves. Program also prints position of selected points. 

I tried to implement editing points by dragging and dropping but this part of code is not working. Program doesn't recognize points as elements 
to drag.
